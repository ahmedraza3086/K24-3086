# PSEUDOCODE Question 1
> Find the maximum number in any of the three variables.
# Start 
Inpur Number 1\
Input Number 2\
Input Number 3\
If Number 1 > Number 2 and Number 1 > Number 3\
then, Print "**Number 1 is maximum**"\
Else,\
If Number 2 > Number 1 and Number 2 > Number 3\ 
then, Print "**Number 2 is maximum**"\
Else,\
If Number 3 > Number 1 and Number 3 > Number 2\
then, Print "**Number 3 is maximum**"\
# End

# PSEUDOCODE Question 2
> Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator 
# Start
Input Number 1\
Input Number 2\
Input Number 3\
For *A*\
A = Multiply Number 2 * (-1)\
For *B*\
B = Number 1 - A\
For *C*\
C = Number 3 * (-1)\
For *Z*\
Z = B - C\
Print "**Z**"
# End

# PSEUDOCODE Question 3
> Create a small calculator which only does ‘+’ or ‘-‘Operations.
# Start
Input Number 1\
Input Number 2\
Input Operator\
If Operator = "**+**"\
then,\
y = Number 1 + Number 2\
Print "**y**"\
Else,\
If Operator = "**-**"\
then,\
z = Number 1 - Number 2\
Print "**z**"\
# End

# ALGORITHM Question 1
> Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
# Start
Ask User to Input "**n**"\
Ask User to Input "**N**"\
Divide "**n**" by "**N**"\
y = n/N\
If remainder is zero\
Print "**N is a divisor of n**"\
Divide y by 2\
y/2\
If remainder is zero\
then,\
Print "**N is even**"\
Else,\
Print "**N is odd**"\
# End
