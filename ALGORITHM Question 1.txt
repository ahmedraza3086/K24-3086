> Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.
# Start
Ask User to Input "**n**"\
Ask User to Input "**N**"\
Divide "**n**" by "**N**"\
y = n/N\
If remainder is zero\
Print "**N is a divisor of n**"\
Divide y by 2\
y/2\
If remainder is zero\
then,\
Print "**N is even**"\
Else,\
Print "**N is odd**"\
# End
